<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>The directions to my game as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You control the player sprite and can move it across the screen</li>
<li>You must avoid the falling spikes by moving away from them</li>
<li>If you get hit by a spike, you get the 'game over' screen</li>
<li>The goal is to last for as long as possible</li>
</ul>
